=== Introduction

The objective of this book is to compile the best practices in Threat Intelligence Analysis with the support of the Open Source Threat Intelligence platform https://www.misp-project.org/[MISP]. The best practices described here are from Information Sharing communities (ISAC or CSIRT) which are regularly using MISP to support their work and sharing practices.
